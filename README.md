# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.

I love interactive tutorials, online courses, and computer-based training. :)

And now this repository has two, count 'em, TWO (2) Python scripts!

draw.py:      Draws an 18-sided polygon (self-intersecting).  
triangle.py:  Draws an equilateral triangle.
